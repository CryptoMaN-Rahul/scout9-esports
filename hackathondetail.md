REQUIREMENTS
WHAT TO BUILD

Entrants must build or update a working application that uses JetBrains IDEs and Junie and submit it into one of the following categories:

Category 1 - A comprehensive Assistant Coach powered by Data Science and AI: that merges micro-level player analytics with macro-level strategic review. Inspired by Moneyball (Jonah Hill’s Peter Brand), this near-real-time application analyzes historical match data to provide a holistic and actionable review. The platform crunches the numbers to identify recurring individual mistakes and connects them directly to their impact on team-wide macro strategy, generating targeted insights for coaches and players.

Category 2 - Automated Scouting Report Generator: An application that, given an upcoming opponent, automatically scours GRID data from their recent matches to generate a concise scouting report. The report would highlight common strategies, player tendencies, and default site setups (for VAL), or recently played comps (for LoL & VAL).

Category 3 - AI Drafting Assistant/Drafting Predictor (LoL): Develop a tool that analyzes historical GRID data (team compositions, player champion/agent pools, win rates, champion synergies, patch data, recent games history) to recommend optimal draft strategies, picks, and bans against specific opponents in real-time during the pick/ban phase.

Category 4 - Event Game: Develop a mini-game that can be played by fans at a LCS or VCT Event Booth or Finals Activation. The winning project will be integrated into a future Cloud9 & JetBrains Event Booth.
Please read through the Submission Specifics page for full details.

WHAT TO SUBMIT

Provide a URL to your code repository for judging and testing.

The repository must contain all necessary source code, assets, and instructions required for the project to be functional. The repository must be public with an approved OSI Open Source License in the About Me section. 

Include a video (about 3 minutes) that demonstrates your submission. Videos must be uploaded to YouTube, Vimeo, or Facebook Video and made public.

CATEGORY 2: AUTOMATED SCOUTING REPORT GENERATOR

What to Build

You are a Data Analyst for Cloud9's coaching staff. Before every match, the team needs a concise, data-driven breakdown of the upcoming opponent. This breakdown when presented in a digestible format, is called a Scouting Report. Your task is to build an application that automates this "pre-game" analysis and generates a Scouting Report.

For any opponent, your application must automatically scour GRID Historical Match Data from their recent matches to generate a concise, actionable scouting report. This tool should be the one-stop guide a coach or player needs to understand an enemy's strategic patterns, player habits, most-played or most-recent compositions.

Scouting Report Requirements

Your application could perform the following core functions, powered by official esports data from GRID (for League of Legends and VALORANT).

Identify Common Team-wide Strategies: The report could analyze recent matches to find and summarize macro-level patterns. (e.g., Are they aggressive early? Do they always contest the first objective? What is their default attack-side pistol round in VALORANT?)

Highlight Key Player Tendencies: The report could pinpoint individual player habits, champion/agent pools, and statistical outliers. (e.g., What is the jungler's most-played path? Which agents does their star duelist play? Is a player particularly weak in certain matchups?)

Summarize Compositions & Setups: The report could show what the team typically runs. This could include recently played team compositions, preferred builds (for LoL), or common default defensive site setups (for VALORANT).

How can you take it to the next level?

Generate "How to Win" Insights: Instead of just listing an opponent's tendencies, your tool could suggest a direct, data-backed counter-strategy or identify an exploitable weakness. (e.g., "Opponent X has a 15% win rate when their mid-laner is against an assassin. Recommend picking LeBlanc and Zed.")

You have the freedom to develop the project in any direction you consider valuable, leveraging your creative ideas and the available data. 

Demonstration Prompts & Required Outputs

Your submission (in your video and/or a live demo) must demonstrate your tool successfully generating a scouting report for a given opponent. The following outputs are examples only, intended to illustrate the type and depth of analysis your tool should be capable of. Hackers have the freedom to and are welcome to let the creative juices flow!

Important: Your submission is not bound by these specific examples. You will not receive additional points for successfully replicating these exact outputs. The tool will be judged on its overall functionality and value.
For all outputs, your system should provide the data or reasoning behind its insights.

Main Prompt: Generate Scouting Report


Task: "Generate a full scouting report for [Opponent Team Name] based on their last [X] matches."

Example Output (VALORANT): Generated Scouting Report for [Team X] in a digestible reporting format (The example given below can be treated as a shortened version of the reporting format)

Common Strategies: On Attack, 70% of pistol rounds are a 5-man fast-hit on B-Site (Ascent). On Defense, they default to a 1-3-1 setup, rotating their Sentinel to mid.

Player Tendencies: Player "Jett" has a 75% first-duel rate with an Operator on A-main defense.

Recent Compositions: Most-played comp (68% on Split): Jett, Raze, Brimstone, Skye, Cypher.

Let the creative juices flow!

Example Output (League of Legends): Generated Scouting Report for [Team Y] in a digestible reporting format (The example given below can be treated as a shortened version of the reporting format)

Common Strategies: Prioritizes first Drake (82% contest rate). Tends to 4-man group for first tower push, usually in bot lane at ~13 mins.

Player Tendencies: Top laner has a 90% pick/ban rate on Renekton (either plays it or bans it). Mid laner has a KDA of 2.1 on control mages vs. 8.5 on assassins, indicating a clear weakness/preference.

Recent Compositions: Most-played comp (60%): Ornn (Top), Viego (Jng), Azir (Mid), Zeri (Bot), Lulu (Sup). (This is a late-game, team-fight-oriented 'protect the carry' comp.)

Actionable Insight: This team's win condition is their bot lane. Their jungler paths to bot 75% of the time pre-10 mins. Recommend aggressive counter-jungling on their top side and prioritizing early ganks on their mid-laner to shut down their secondary carry.

Let the creative juices flow!

👌Resolution/Answer

Everything starts with getting Series IDs from Central Data https://api-op.grid.gg/central-data/graphql 
First you query to get the available titles
query Titles {
    titles {
        id
        name
    }
}
Then you query to get Tournaments in a specific title
query Tournaments {
    tournaments(filter: { title: { id: { in: ["3"] } } }) {
        totalCount
        edges {
            node {
                id
                name
            }
        }
    }
}
Then you check if there are any series with that Tournament
query AllSeries {
    allSeries(
        filter: { tournament: { id: { in: 756907 }, includeChildren: { equals: true } } }
        orderBy: StartTimeScheduled
    ) {
        totalCount
        edges {
            node {
                id
                startTimeScheduled
                teams {
                    baseInfo {
                        id
                        name
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        pageInfo {
            endCursor
            hasNextPage
        }
    }
}
And this gives you series IDs that you can use in the Series State API and the File Download API
